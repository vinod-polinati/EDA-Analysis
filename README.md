# Traffic Accidents Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates various data preprocessing and visualization techniques using a traffic accidents dataset. The dataset is downloaded from OpenML (data_id=42803) and analyzed using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Missingno.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Missingno

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
